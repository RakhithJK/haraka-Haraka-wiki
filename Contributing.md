We love and value outside contributions to Haraka.

If you wish to contribute, please use the Github "Pull Request" mechanism - fork the project, create a branch for your changes, commit and push them to your repository, and click on "Create Pull Request" for that branch in Github.

Please follow these style conventions:

* 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Semi-colons on the end of statements are preferred
* Use underscores\_to\_separate\_names (yes this goes against JS conventions - it's the way it has always been done)
* Do not [cuddle elses](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CuddledElseBlocks)
* Use whitespace between operators - we prefer `if (foo > bar)` over `if(foo>bar)`
